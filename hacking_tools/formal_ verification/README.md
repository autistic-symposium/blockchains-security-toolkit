#### yul

<br>

* yul (previously also called julia) is an intermediate statically-typed language that can be compiled to bytecode for different backends. 
* it's a good target for high-level optimisation stages, as it provides flexibility, speed, and interoperates easily with high-level solidity.
* programs written in yul are readable even if the code is generated by a compiler from solidity. 
* because yul needs to be compiled to bytecode, it requires additional time to complete the entire compilation process, making it time-consuming during development.
